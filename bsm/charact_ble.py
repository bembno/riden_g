Based on exhaustive testing, your JK BMS requires:

üîß HARDWARE RESET (REQUIRED):
1. DISCONNECT from battery completely
2. Wait 3-5 MINUTES (critical)
3. Look for PHYSICAL RESET BUTTON
4. Press and hold for 15+ seconds
5. RECONNECT battery

üìû CONTACT MANUFACTURER:
- Provide this diagnostic output
- Ask for "factory reset procedure" 
- Mention "BMS only broadcasts AT, no command response"

üîÑ ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS:
- Try different JK BMS mobile app
- Check for firmware update
- Consider replacement if under warranty

The software approach is exhausted. The BMS firmware is in a
state that requires physical intervention to recover.
